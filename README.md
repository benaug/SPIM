# SPIM
 Models fit:  2-Flank spatial partial identity model (SPIM), categorical SPIM, conventional and generalized categorical SMR. 
 
 No longer maintained, here for reproducibility reasons. Use nimble samplers also on github.

Note, the spatial mark-resight samplers in this package do not correctly handle "marked but not identfied" and "unknown mark status" samples.

I will upload nimble samplers that handle all sample types in SMR at some point.
